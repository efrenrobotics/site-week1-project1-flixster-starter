### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I believe that all the labs that we did tied into this project. From our lab 1 which was the personal website which made me feel comfortable with flex box. Then lab 2 really helped implement javascript and using the DOM model. Lab 3 was helpful with the forms and taught us how to connect the API.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I wanted to add more information about the movies. Improve the style of the website and I feel like it would have been really cool to allow the user to play trailers.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

It was really hard to get used to API's and Javascript syntax. I was able to grasp the concept pretty well but the syntax would always get me. I think that once I was able to connect the API and understand what was going on I was able to pick up the pace. I would have liked to add some hovers on the movie cards to show which one the mouse is over.

### Open-source libraries used
